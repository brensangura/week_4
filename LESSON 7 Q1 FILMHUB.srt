 of evil I have Elder

 Welcome everyone.

00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:53,332
 May you be blessed as we

29
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:54,276

 Amen.

31
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,800
 The problem of evil

32
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,860
 is a

33
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,444
 topic that

34
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:02,160
 is

35
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,680
 very

36
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,960
 somewhat

37
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,160
 not joyous

38
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,884
 at the same time

39
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:11,760
 not

40
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,220
 it's something that all of

41
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,842
 us have experienced.

42
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,430
 But the Lord will guide us

43
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,410
 as we discuss

44
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,526
 and as we encourage one another.

45
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:23,690
 Let us sing.

46
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,770
My Jesus, I love
you.

47
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,430
 I love

48
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,270
 me.

49
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,190
 I know

50
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,110
 that

51
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,146
 my

52
00:02:15,298 --> 00:02:17,710
 gracious,

53
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,774
 My

54
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,290
 Savior,

55
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,010
 I love

56
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,974
 the my

57
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:40,570
 Jesus.

58
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,030
 Father, we have come to you

59
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,970
 once again

60
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,570
 to learn at your feet

61
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,950
 we come as empty

62
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,290
 as we are.

63
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,530
 Father, please fill us today.

64
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,094
 Though sinful we are,

65
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:04,710
 but we are here before you

66
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,926
 to be cleansed.

67
00:04:06,118 --> 00:04:07,622
 Cleanse us, Forgive our

68
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:09,382
 sins that the

69
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:10,470
 meditations of our heart

70
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,526
 and the words of our

71
00:04:11,558 --> 00:04:13,094
mouth may be acceptable unto

72
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:14,550
 you today.

73
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,782
 Oh Lord, minister to our

74
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,402
 listeners at home home and

75
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:19,402
 let us all be blessed in

76
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,330
 Jesus name.

77
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,470
 Amen.

78
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,002
 The problem of

79
00:04:25,106 --> 00:04:26,778
 evil and God will

80
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:27,754
 wipe away.

81
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:29,914
 That's a very encouraging

82
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:30,710
 part.

83
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,322
 If you have gone through

84
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:34,190
 evil,

85
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,682
 if you know someone

86
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,650
 who are going through evil,

87
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,202
 injustice, pain,

88
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,790
 sickness, disease,

89
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,040
 death of loved ones,

90
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,844
 premature death,

91
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:47,280
 tragic death,

92
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,644
 cancer.

93
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:50,600
 Things that has happened

94
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,756
 in our

95
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:54,756
 history, in our human experience

96
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:55,908
 that are

97
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:57,000
 painful.

98
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,764
 We are told in

99
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:01,652
 Revelation 21, verse

100
00:05:01,716 --> 00:05:02,900
 4 that

101
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,852
 God will

102
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:06,788
 wipe away every tear

103
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:08,610
 from our eyes.

104
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,822
There shall be no more death.

105
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:13,810
 That is the highest

106
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,622
 point of disappointment

107
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,334
 and evil in human

108
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:19,050
 history.

109
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,118
 Even in the

110
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:23,070
 history of God's creation.

111
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,750
 Even in in the

112
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,670
 entire both

113
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,890
 in heaven and earth.

114
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,158
 Death is not something that

115
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:31,822
 God look forward to, that

116
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:33,534
 God loves because originally

117
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:35,010
 it was not his intention.

118
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,680
 So we are consoled to know

119
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,584
 that God will wipe

120
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,104
 away every

121
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:42,592
 fear from our

122
00:05:42,616 --> 00:05:43,296
 eyes.

123
00:05:43,488 --> 00:05:45,420
 There shall be no more death,

124
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,376
 nor sorrow.

125
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:49,552
 No more crying, no

126
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:51,216
 more pain, no more disease,

127
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:52,848
 no more sicknesses,

128
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:54,192
 no more poverty,

129
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:55,968
 starvation, no more

130
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:56,980
 injustice.

131
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,040
 There shall be no more pain

132
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,540
 for the former things

133
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,410
 have passed

134
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,270
 away.

135
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,154
 Perhaps the greatest problem

136
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:08,138
 facing the entire human

137
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:09,802
 race today, I wouldn't just

138
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:11,642
 say Christian religion, the

139
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,642
 entire human race, the entire

140
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,546
 human experience is

141
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:16,858
 this problem of

142
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:17,630
 evil.

143
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,378
 I'm sure you have experienced

144
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:21,850
 pain, you have

145
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,114
 experienced evil.

146
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:24,298
 Have Experienced loss.

147
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:25,270
 You have experience

148
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,700
 something that you know,

149
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,332
 this one is not in the plan

150
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,720
 of God for me.

151
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,284
 So that is one of the greatest

152
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:34,212
 problem we.

153
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:35,700
 We each face today.

154
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,732
 And many times, how do

155
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:39,460
 we reconcile this with the

156
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,380
 fact that we know

157
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,724
 that God is

158
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:44,080
 perfectly good?

159
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,420
 And this God is so

160
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,276
 perfect, he's so loving,

161
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:49,252
 he's so.

162
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:51,156
 He cares about us so much,

163
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:52,080
 and yet

164
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,488
 we live in a

165
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:56,264
 world that is filled

166
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:57,740
 with evil.

167
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,340
 So many people,

168
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,392
 it becomes so difficult for

169
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,880
 them to come to terms.

170
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,656
 If God is all

171
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:07,640
 good, as we say

172
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,580
 he is,

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,400
 and all powerful,

174
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,160
 then that question,

175
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,648
 why evil?

176
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:16,264
 Why is there so much evil

177
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,310
 in our world?

178
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,074
 Why is there so much

179
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:21,138
 pain and disease and

180
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:22,070
 poverty?

181
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,266
 Why are so much

182
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:26,150
 trouble?

183
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,986
 Why is it that these troubles

184
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:29,554
 have become part of our human

185
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:30,270
 experience?

186
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,186
 And many people, you know,

187
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:35,058
 keep facing these

188
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:36,802
 things and they keep asking,

189
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:38,470
 where is the love of God?

190
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,882
 So to many minds, the

191
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:42,786
 origin of sin and the reason

192
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:44,530
 for its existence actually

193
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,304
 a source of great perplexity.

194
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:48,000
 I know many people

195
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,372
 that because of

196
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:52,420
 the situation of our

197
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,620
 world, has said there is

198
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,440
 no God.

199
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,440
 I was walking

200
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,188
 in Norway many

201
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:00,804
 years ago, actually

202
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:02,692
 2004, and I met

203
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:05,284
someone who was challenging me.

204
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:06,996
 He said, can you see my hands

205
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:07,960
 are walking?

206
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,876
 He lifted his hands.

207
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:11,638
 He said, this hand is walking.

208
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,490
He said.
He said, can you see my.

209
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,010
 Can you see this mansion?

210
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,898
 He has a very big house.

211
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:18,470
 He said, which God?

212
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,610
 This is my.

213
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,874
 The works of my hand.

214
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:23,070
 I did it.

215
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,042
 I was just looking at the

216
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,870
 man because he's still breathing.

217
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,602
 If God takes away the air,

218
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:31,122
he realized that they are sick.

219
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:32,914
 Many years ago, I was walking

220
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:34,530
 here and also met a

221
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,710
 man who

222
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,434
 was in Rwanda

223
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:39,950
 in 1994.

224
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,228
 He was a

225
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:43,080
 pastor.

226
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,060
 He finished

227
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,800
 theology school

228
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,044
 here in the United States

229
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:50,132
 and moved over.

230
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:51,780
 Actually graduated from La

231
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,636
 Sierra University and moved

232
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:54,724
 over to Rwanda.

233
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:56,400
 And he was there

234
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,840
 in that genocide.

235
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,380
 So he came

236
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,300
 back and

237
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,920
 said, there is no more God.

238
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,358
 Become an atheist from

239
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,102
 pastor and I

240
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:09,918
 engage him.

241
00:09:09,974 --> 00:09:11,342
 You know, the most difficult

242
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:12,990
 person is someone who's been

243
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,846
 through, who already knows

244
00:09:14,878 --> 00:09:16,222
 everything through theology.

245
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:17,454
 What are you going to pull?

246
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:18,702
 What are you going to.

247
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:20,302
 So many people, because of

248
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,726
 the situation of the world,

249
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:23,758
 when they face a

250
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,566
 certain level of evil,

251
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:27,290
 they begin to question

252
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,974
 our rationale.

253
00:09:29,022 --> 00:09:30,250
 But the good news

254
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,010
 is that

255
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,574
 despite the evil

256
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:35,982
 that exists in our world,

257
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:37,790
 we have a God

258
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,310
 who has infinite

259
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,118
 love, infinite

260
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,214
power and infinite wisdom.

261
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:44,894
 Unfortunately, sometimes

262
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:46,670
 he doesn't use that

263
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,250
 power always.

264
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,510
 That is the truth.

265
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,606
 God uses more of

266
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:54,238
 love and

267
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,030
 mercy and grace than he

268
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,878
 utilizes his

269
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,330
 sovereign power.

270
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,190
 Many of us have been in

271
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,630
 situations where we have

272
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,486
 asked this question, how

273
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,410
 long O Lord,

274
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,694
 how long, O Lord?

275
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,210
 In fact, I

276
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,438
 change it here to say because

277
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:14,454
 of the domineering and

278
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:16,230
 enduring presence of

279
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,046
 evil.

280
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:18,950
 There are times we have been

281
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,886
 in situations where

282
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,790
 we begin to ask God, is this

283
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,810
 gonna end?

284
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,880
 How long?

285
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,716
How long is this going to be?

286
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:31,000
So the problem of evil is real.

287
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,436
 It is real, and it's

288
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:35,276
 a very big problem that puts

289
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:37,260
 a lot of question marks on

290
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,988
 the goodness of

291
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:39,680
 God.

292
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,800
 Can we

293
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,804
 please look at

294
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:45,324
 job 30, verse

295
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:46,280
 26?

296
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,680
 So I looked for good,

297
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,990
 but evil

298
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,910
 came instead.

299
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,866
 My heart is

300
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:57,338
 troubled and

301
00:10:57,394 --> 00:10:58,110
 restless.

302
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,554
 Days of suffering

303
00:11:00,682 --> 00:11:01,990
 torment me.

304
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:05,962
 Days of.

305
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,658
 Because Job was in that

306
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:09,670
 situation where he was like,

307
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,110
 how long,

308
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,370
 God, are you sure this

309
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,630
 is going to end?

310
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,600
How long is this going to be?

311
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,620
 The night has become

312
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,540
 so long and the

313
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,600
daybreak was not there.

314
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,908
 And we look at again

315
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:27,908
 Jeremiah, the Prophet in

316
00:11:27,964 --> 00:11:29,200
 12:1.

317
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,892
 He answered that question

318
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:33,604
 in a way righteous

319
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,240
 are you, O Lord,

320
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,188
 when I plead with

321
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:39,200
 you, yet

322
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,742
 let me talk

323
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:43,230
 with you about your

324
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,130
 judgment.

325
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,622
 Why does the way of

326
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:47,570
 the wicked

327
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,010
 prosper?

328
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,774
 Why are those

329
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,422
 happy who deal

330
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:54,126
 so

331
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:55,598
 treacherously?

332
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:56,830
 And sometimes

333
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,862
 honestly, some of

334
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,542
 these treacherous

335
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:02,190
 people seem to be prospering

336
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,250
there, sir.

337
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,450
Yeah. What experience do you want to share?

338
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,490
 Well,

339
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,890
 evil people

340
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,450
 prosper a lot.

341
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,730
 A lot.

342
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,374
You see somebody who doesn't know God.

343
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:19,970
 You see somebody who

344
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,070
 even speak bad of

345
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,990
 God, so disrespectful to

346
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,590
 God, but in his

347
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,158
 business he's making

348
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:27,850
 waves.

349
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,982
 Like I started an example

350
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:31,650
 before.

351
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,854
 A very popular person that

352
00:12:33,982 --> 00:12:35,102
 anybody who hears this will

353
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:36,846
know the person right away.
Yes.

354
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:37,870
 We're talking, say.

355
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,014
Well, if you say there is heaven.
Yes.

356
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:41,742
 If you say there is paradise,

357
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,942
 he doesn't believe it.

358
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:44,850
 But if it exists,

359
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,430
 I would like to.

360
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,450
Yeah. It won't be bad to visit.

361
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,502
 It's okay.

362
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:52,382
 But it's okay.

363
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:53,934
 And he's the richest

364
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,410
person in the world.

365
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,702
 So that person,

366
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:01,146
God allowed him to make his way.

367
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:03,122
 God gave him the intelligence.

368
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:04,626
 God prospered him.

369
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:06,450
 God blessed everything he

370
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,298
 touched.

371
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:09,010
 Yet he's not

372
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,890
 religious.

373
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,970
 He doesn't believe that you

374
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,570
 need any special connection

375
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,154
 with any power

376
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:15,890
 anywhere.

377
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,690
 Yes.

378
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,242
 So when you look at that

379
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:19,634
 and you that you are worshiping

380
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:21,330
God day and night.
Yes.

381
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,514
 You are not lazy in your

382
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:23,714
 office, in your job.

383
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,450
 Yes.

384
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,370
 You went to school, yet you

385
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,968
don't see you are not really making it.

386
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:29,816
 That's right.

387
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:31,384
 Then you query God, God,

388
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:32,540
 what is happening?

389
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,264
 You asked me to worship,

390
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:35,016
 I'm doing it.

391
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:36,920
 But we need to know

392
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,360
 that the same Bible says

393
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,304
we should not envy that.

394
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:42,820
 Then we should not

395
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,368
 bother to gather our

396
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,920
 treasure in this

397
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,648
 earth, because our

398
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,300
 reward is in heaven.

399
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,520
 Because what does

400
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,510
 it prosper in man who

401
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,366
 gains all this word.

402
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:57,370
 And yet.

403
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,382
 So it's better to

404
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,250
 keep focusing on

405
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,406
 the goal.

406
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:04,702
 And that is heaven.

407
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:05,918
 All right, Dr.

408
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:06,558
 Esther.

409
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:07,502
 Yeah, yeah.

410
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:09,342
 So I like that

411
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:10,846
 question you asked, Pastor.

412
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,718
 Why do

413
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:14,718
 the wicked ones seem to

414
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:16,622
 prosper, even sometimes more

415
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:18,750
than the so called Christian?

416
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,490
 Yes, but there's something

417
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,190
 that Job

418
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,714
 found out.

419
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:25,570
 God let Job know that not

420
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,882
 everything, there's not.
- It's

421
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:28,482
 not everything that he can understand.

422
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:29,602
 Same thing with us.

423
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:30,770
 It's not everything that

424
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,002
 we are going to understand.

425
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:33,426
 There are some things only

426
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,658
 best known to God.

427
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:35,790
 And just like

428
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,290
 eventually all of these

429
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,842
 riches of this world is going

430
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:41,650
 to come to an end, it's going

431
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,586
 to turn to nothing.

432
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:44,914
 Heaven is the goal.

433
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:48,098
So once you have at the back of 
your mind that heaven

434
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:49,538
 is the goal, you will not

435
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:50,978
 be influenced or

436
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:52,700
 confused by the

437
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,884
 wicked being

438
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:54,988
 prospering.

439
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:56,636
 And we should not envy

440
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:58,492
 them when they are prospering

441
00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:00,492
 like that because God of

442
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:01,756
 justice will still bring

443
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:03,404
 justice upon the wicked

444
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:04,156
 eventually.

445
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:05,100
 Amen.

446
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,236
 And Dr.

447
00:15:06,348 --> 00:15:08,300
 Jail, where

448
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,724
 is God when evil

449
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:10,412
 occurs?

450
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:12,120
 Why do you think

451
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,348
 God is all

452
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:15,600
 this powerful?

453
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,040
Why still evil in the world?

454
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,820
 God is where he was when

455
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,756
 he allowed Jesus to

456
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:23,640
 crucify,

457
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,180
 is where he was when

458
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,684
 Jesus said,

459
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:29,748
 father, why

460
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,160
 hast thou forsaken?

461
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,480
 He's still on the truth.

462
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,252
 And that is why there are

463
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:36,080
 some things

464
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,400
 he did not understand.

465
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,300
 And may I quickly add

466
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,756
 that God is not the author

467
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:43,720
 of evil.

468
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,984
 God did not bring evil.

469
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,536
 As we study this lesson,

470
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:48,880
 for that that we unravel,

471
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,592
 we see, but God

472
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:52,176
 did not bring about

473
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:53,168
 evil.

474
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:55,424
It is disobedience that led to evil.

475
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:57,040
 And God did not cause

476
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,000
 disobedience.

477
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,848
 That's right.

478
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:00,768
 All right, so

479
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:02,704
 the question now is, why

480
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,260
 do the righteous

481
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,020
 suffer?

482
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,968
 If God is a good

483
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:10,460
God, he created a good world.

484
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,016
 Where is he

485
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:14,952
 when in quote, the

486
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:16,808
 righteous are suffering and

487
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:18,280
 the wicked are

488
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,032
 prospering.

489
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:20,872
 They are having their way.

490
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:22,968
 They are materially speaking,

491
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:25,096
things are working well for them.

492
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:27,032
 And you who prays to

493
00:16:27,056 --> 00:16:28,728
 this God all the time,

494
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,664
 fast, who goes

495
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:32,152
 to church, who is

496
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:33,180
 committed,

497
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,528
 yet things are not

498
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,200
 going well

499
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,196
 for you?

500
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:39,588
 Well, God is

501
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:40,308
 touched.

502
00:16:40,404 --> 00:16:41,700
 That's why I raised that

503
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,372
 question.

504
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:44,052
 God is touched by

505
00:16:44,156 --> 00:16:45,560
 human suffering

506
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,820
 and the evils that

507
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,012
we each experience along the way.

508
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:52,420
 The question that is

509
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,324
 begging for answers

510
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,100
 will be, have each and every

511
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,428
 one of us here, who among

512
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:58,644
 us here has an experience

513
00:16:58,732 --> 00:16:59,360
 level?

514
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,956
 Who among us having experience

515
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:04,012
 level all

516
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:05,900
 the things we pray for, does

517
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,516
 it come to pass?

518
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:09,340
 Do we get all that we

519
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,236
 pray for?

520
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:12,012
 God is touched by human

521
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:12,880
 suffering.

522
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,572
 God also

523
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:15,600
 grieves

524
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,460
 at each of

525
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,400
 Our loss

526
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,172
 at each of our pain, the

527
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:24,060
 death of our loved ones,

528
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,900
 the injustices that we

529
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,260
 face, the

530
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,180
 evil that we experience

531
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,860
 in our world today persists.

532
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,588
 Because God is not the

533
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:33,912
 only one with

534
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:35,968
 power of

535
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:36,660
 choice.

536
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,752
 That is the answer.

537
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:40,800
 Satan also has the

538
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,260
power of choice, and he uses it.

539
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,140
 The gracious

540
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,648
 also has the

541
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:50,064
power of choice as well.

542
00:17:50,232 --> 00:17:51,808
 So Satan, as well as

543
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:53,760
 human beings can choose

544
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,248
 too, to

545
00:17:55,304 --> 00:17:57,152
 utilize their power of choice

546
00:17:57,216 --> 00:17:58,740
 to inflict pain

547
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,790
 on us,

548
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,470
 to also thwart

549
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,986
 the plan of God.

550
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,282
 I know many people that will

551
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:07,258
 be shocking to them.

552
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:07,946
 Does it mean.

553
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:08,698
 Yes.

554
00:18:08,874 --> 00:18:10,330
 The plan of God does not

555
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,362
 always materialize the way

556
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:13,830
 he envisions it.

557
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,690
 God also get

558
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,750
 frustrated

559
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,418
 because he doesn't use his

560
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,434
 mighty power all the time.

561
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:22,922
 Instead, he

562
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:24,794
 leads us through our

563
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:26,680
 power of choice,

564
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,696
 through our free will

565
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:29,900
 to decide.

566
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,260
 So when you look at

567
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,420
 Matthew 27,

568
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,392
 verse 42, Jesus

569
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:37,800
 also faced the

570
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,220
 harshest experience.

571
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,992
 Because of evil,

572
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:43,660
 because of our sins.

573
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,592
 He had to ask

574
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,288
 God, where are you?

575
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:49,060
 Just like all of us,

576
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,944
 at a particular time in our

577
00:18:51,952 --> 00:18:53,708
 life, as usual, he

578
00:18:53,764 --> 00:18:54,940
 has to feel the

579
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,540
 abandonment of the

580
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,380
 absence of God

581
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,380
 to intervene at the most

582
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,028
 painful time in his

583
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:04,636
human and divine experience.

584
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:06,560
 So God also suffers.

585
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,620
 You believe that?

586
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,156
 Yes, God also

587
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:10,924
 suffers.

588
00:19:11,052 --> 00:19:12,428
 Do you know what it took

589
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,720
 God to watch?

590
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,780
 His son.

591
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,840
 His son.

592
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,052
 Ellen White said that God

593
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,000
 couldn't even look at

594
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,162
 him.

595
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:23,986
 God couldn't look at his

596
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:24,670
 face.

597
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,650
 And Jesus even called,

598
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,550
 reached out to God and said,

599
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,550
 are you still there?

600
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,570
 God was there.

601
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,010
 But at that time, the

602
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,590
 weight of

603
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,898
 seeing the

604
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:40,738
 load and everything was

605
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:41,750
 on Jesus.

606
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,350
 And he has to go through

607
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,310
 the way of the cross.

608
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,342
 That's something that we

609
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:49,062
 cannot say.

610
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:50,570
 We have all the answers

611
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,662
 because it's too deep for

612
00:19:52,686 --> 00:19:54,486
 us to comprehend.

613
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:56,262
 So we are called to choose

614
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:57,638
 wisely, to make the best

615
00:19:57,694 --> 00:19:59,290
 use of our choices,

616
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,622
 to choose wisely and to stand

617
00:20:01,726 --> 00:20:03,558
 by God, to partner with

618
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:05,286
 God, to work with

619
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:06,950
 him and to

620
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,570
 create meaningful

621
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,742
 and impactful and rewarding

622
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:12,310
 experiences devoid of

623
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,046
 evil.

624
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:14,886
 Because many times people

625
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,610
 stay in this how long?

626
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,662
 Experience because of

627
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,598
 human choices, because

628
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,134
 people are inflicting

629
00:20:22,182 --> 00:20:22,810
 pain.

630
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,846
 We've seen injustices

631
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:27,206
 in some way.

632
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:28,806
 We've seen people that use

633
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:30,806
 their pen to just

634
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:32,050
 sign something

635
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,294
 and they have just signed

636
00:20:34,342 --> 00:20:36,182
 to kill an innocent man.

637
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:38,330
 We've seen people that spend

638
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,192
 27 years,

639
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:42,096
 30 years in prison

640
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:44,176
 and the police knew

641
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,600
 that they were not the one

642
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,088
 that committed the crime.

643
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:49,340
But they have to close the case.

644
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,584
 The police is bribed,

645
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:53,520
 the judge was bribed.

646
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,088
 They had to do something

647
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:56,384
 to cover someone.

648
00:20:56,552 --> 00:20:58,128
 And an innocent man was

649
00:20:58,184 --> 00:20:59,968
 sent to jail

650
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:00,928
 for 30 years.

651
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:02,336
 In fact, we've seen many

652
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:03,600
 People sent to the death

653
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,340
 row.

654
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,642
 That means they actually

655
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:07,794
 got killed.

656
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:09,810
 They got executed for a

657
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,330
 crime that they did not

658
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,098
 commit.

659
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:14,226
So these are things that happen.

660
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:15,710
 And many times

661
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,570
 there are many of these things

662
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,430
that we don't have all the answers.

663
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,470
 We cannot say

664
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,338
we know why this has happened.

665
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:25,986
 Now let us look at Job.

666
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:27,550
 Job was in this experience

667
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,210
 because many times we seem

668
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,562
to, you know, behave like we

669
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:35,082
 have all the answers to some

670
00:21:35,106 --> 00:21:36,618
things, all the things that happen.

671
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:38,746
Let us see.
Job 38,

672
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,390
 verse 1 through 12.

673
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,402
 Then the Lord spoke to Job

674
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:44,714
 out of the storm.

675
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:46,570
 He said, who is

676
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,378
 this that obscures my

677
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:50,170
 plans with words

678
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,306
 without knowledge?

679
00:21:51,418 --> 00:21:53,258
 Brace yourself like a man.

680
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:55,002
 I will question you, and

681
00:21:55,026 --> 00:21:56,400
 you shall answer me.

682
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,116
 Where were you when I laid

683
00:21:58,148 --> 00:21:59,476
 the earth's foundation?

684
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:01,040
 Tell me if you understand,

685
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,868
 who marked off its

686
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:04,036
 dimensions?

687
00:22:04,228 --> 00:22:05,600
 Surely you know

688
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,252
 who stretched a

689
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:08,676
 measuring line across

690
00:22:08,748 --> 00:22:10,212
 it On.

691
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:12,676
On what were its footings set?

692
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,180
 Or who laid its

693
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,052
 cornerstone while the

694
00:22:16,076 --> 00:22:17,732
 Morningstar sang together

695
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,396
 and all the angels shouted

696
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:20,440
 for joy?

697
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,448
 Who shut up the see

698
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:24,448
 behind doors when it burst

699
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:25,840
 forth from the room?

700
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,680
 When I made the clouds its

701
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,500
 garment and wrapped it in.

702
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,488
 Wrapped it in thick

703
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,424
 darkness When I fixed

704
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,360
 limits for it and set its

705
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,800
 doors and bars in

706
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,448
 place When I

707
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:40,128
 said, this far you may

708
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:41,840
 come and no further.

709
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,904
 Here is where your proud

710
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:44,896
 waves ought.

711
00:22:45,008 --> 00:22:46,656
 Have you ever given orders

712
00:22:46,688 --> 00:22:48,660
 to the money or shown

713
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,270
 the dawn its place?

714
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,230
 That's it, all right.

715
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,466
 So the question God was posing

716
00:22:57,498 --> 00:22:58,858
 to Job here is something

717
00:22:58,914 --> 00:23:00,762
 that all of us should ponder

718
00:23:00,906 --> 00:23:01,590
 on.

719
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,994
 Were you there when I laid

720
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:05,630
 the foundation of the earth?

721
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,730
 Do you know the one who commands

722
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,434
 day?

723
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:11,150
 And there is daybreak.

724
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,650
 Can you explain how it

725
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,510
 happens?

726
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,038
 And when it's night, okay,

727
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:17,758
 it's night.

728
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:19,806
 It's something that was shocking

729
00:23:19,838 --> 00:23:21,790
 to me the first time I went

730
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,570
 to Europe,

731
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,006
 precisely in Norway,

732
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:26,830
 that during

733
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,410
 some summer times,

734
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,570
 you just have to go to bed

735
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,470
 because it's

736
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,358
 daybreak all

737
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,526
 through is

738
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:37,570
 shocking.

739
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,358
 Like by

740
00:23:39,494 --> 00:23:41,262
 1:00am in the morning,

741
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:42,494
 by 12 midnight,

742
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:43,862
 1:00am,

743
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:46,004
 2:00am it's

744
00:23:46,052 --> 00:23:47,800
 like, wow.

745
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,812
 It's just that everywhere

746
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:51,440
 is very white.

747
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,520
 Everybody's sleeping now.

748
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,964
 There's no.

749
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:56,020
 You know everywhere is.

750
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,204
 You know, you're hearing

751
00:23:57,252 --> 00:23:58,820
 the birds, the

752
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,156
crickets, you know.

753
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:03,124
 So there is someone who makes

754
00:24:03,212 --> 00:24:04,948
 it to go dark.

755
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:06,560
 And it's night,

756
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,812
 right?

757
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:09,108
 And then there's someone

758
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:11,120
 who commands day to come.

759
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,408
 There are someone who says,

760
00:24:13,464 --> 00:24:14,448
 the ocean.

761
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:16,140
 This is where you start

762
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,504
 that, you know.

763
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:19,152
 And many times when the ocean

764
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:20,960
 overflows, you see the

765
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,780
 disaster that comes.

766
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,960
 So God is trying to tell

767
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,900
 us here,

768
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,304
 even in our human experience,

769
00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:29,760
 that there are some things

770
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,540
 we cannot comprehend.

771
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,136
 The End of history.

772
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,912
 We come with the triumph

773
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,928
 of love over

774
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:37,664
 evil.

775
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:39,136
 There is someone who knows

776
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,120
 what he's doing, even

777
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,816
 though it may be very, very

778
00:24:42,888 --> 00:24:43,920
 difficult for us to

779
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,856
 comprehend some

780
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:47,216
 of the things he's doing.

781
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:49,200
 Sometimes let us

782
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,152
 also know that many of the

783
00:24:51,176 --> 00:24:52,512
 things that happen is not

784
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:54,020
 because of our sin.

785
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,840
 It's not because of what

786
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,260
 our parents did.

787
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,180
 It's not because of,

788
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,600
 you know, something that

789
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,780
 we didn't do.

790
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,608
 It's just that there are

791
00:25:04,664 --> 00:25:06,384
 so many other actors.

792
00:25:06,432 --> 00:25:07,760
 There are principalities

793
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,980
 and powers

794
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,770
 that are working

795
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,598
 night and day.

796
00:25:12,654 --> 00:25:14,330
 Although it is very difficult,

797
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,454
 we have to learn to trust

798
00:25:16,502 --> 00:25:18,130
 God in these times

799
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,246
 we are in the dark, we don't

800
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:21,206
 have all the details.

801
00:25:21,238 --> 00:25:22,550
 And that's why it's very

802
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,990
 difficult to

803
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,710
 trust.

804
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,530
When you are in the dark,
you don't have all the details.

805
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,766
 So God is saying, learn

806
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:31,542
 to trust me in those difficult

807
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:33,574
 times, even

808
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,046
 when it is very difficult

809
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:36,732
 for you to trust, learn to

810
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:37,980
 give me praise.

811
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,532
 And that's another thing

812
00:25:39,556 --> 00:25:41,324
 that I have actually experienced

813
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:43,916
my personal journey, my personal life.

814
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:45,532
 When you're in a difficult

815
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:47,196
situation, you start praising God.

816
00:25:47,228 --> 00:25:48,160
 It works.

817
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,840
 It works.

818
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,916
 So let us understand

819
00:25:52,068 --> 00:25:52,760
 that

820
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,180
 we have

821
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,556
 been given

822
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:57,960
 immense power

823
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,108
 and we have to learn to

824
00:26:00,164 --> 00:26:02,038
 use those power

825
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,022
 of choice wisely.

826
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:05,494
 As I stated before,

827
00:26:05,662 --> 00:26:07,414
 someone just signed a signature

828
00:26:07,462 --> 00:26:08,998
 and someone's contract is

829
00:26:09,054 --> 00:26:10,790
 unjustly ended.

830
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,902
 Someone signs a signature

831
00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:14,050
 and someone

832
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,470
 is going to spend the rest

833
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,210
 of their years,

834
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,550
 20 years, 10 years in

835
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,286
 jail.

836
00:26:21,478 --> 00:26:22,886
 Someone is bribed.

837
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:26,022
You know, there are so many
angles to this, and

838
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:27,686
 that is because of this

839
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:28,822
 problem of evil.

840
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:30,842
 So God is calling us to

841
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:32,410
 go into partnership with

842
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,234
 him as we make our choices,

843
00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:36,170
 as we touch people, and as

844
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,930
 we impart their

845
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,930
 lives in those worldwe stay

846
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:40,698
 with us.

847
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:41,626
 Don't go away.

848
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:43,242
 When we return,

849
00:26:43,426 --> 00:26:45,226
 we will continue this conversation.

850
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,230
 Thank you.

851
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,430
 Welcome back.

852
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,386
 There's something called

853
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,430
 skeptical.

854
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,744
 A theist is somebody

855
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,232
 who believes in God.

856
00:27:03,376 --> 00:27:05,220
 That's where we get atheists

857
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,496
 for those who do not believe

858
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:09,380
 in God.

859
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,168
 So the skeptical

860
00:27:11,264 --> 00:27:13,056
 theist is

861
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:14,720
 the one who believes

862
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,768
 that God has good

863
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:18,656
 reasons for acting

864
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:20,220
 the way he does.

865
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,008
 But given our limited

866
00:27:23,104 --> 00:27:24,930
 knowledge that

867
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,882
 we shouldn't expect to be

868
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:27,870
 in a position

869
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,870
 to know

870
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,370
 all the reasons why the

871
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,110
 things that happen happen.

872
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,786
 And if we're

873
00:27:36,818 --> 00:27:38,738
 able to become skeptical

874
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:40,578
 theist, it will

875
00:27:40,634 --> 00:27:41,550
 help us

876
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,034
 to trust God more,

877
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,150
 knowing that

878
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,750
 our knowledge is limited.

879
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,520
 How can you explain

880
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,520
 that a woman

881
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,920
 got married?

882
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,860
 According to her, as

883
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,680
 a virgin

884
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,480
 for 14 years

885
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,640
 they looked for a child

886
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,810
 she couldn't conceive.

887
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,690
 And after 14 years

888
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,170
 she gets a child.

889
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,454
 And then the second child

890
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,006
 comes 13 years

891
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:30,690
 later.

892
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,046
 So she gets a son,

893
00:28:35,158 --> 00:28:36,850
 27 years later,

894
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,690
 she rejoices.

895
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,832
 Now she has a daughter and

896
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:43,700
 a son,

897
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,808
 only to bury this

898
00:28:47,864 --> 00:28:50,096
son 25 years later.

899
00:28:50,248 --> 00:28:50,980
 Yeah.

900
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,220
 And that is my mother's story.

901
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,936
How can you explain this?

902
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:01,940
 What, are you going to justify

903
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,900
 this?

904
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,220
 The only justification

905
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,092
 is that we are in a world

906
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:09,748
 of evil.

907
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:11,412
 That's right, because it

908
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:13,040
 has nothing to do

909
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,200
 with God.

910
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,480
 When my brother died,

911
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,132
 I prayed for God to

912
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:23,280
 resurrect him.

913
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,120
 Because

914
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,876
 I know that God

915
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:29,492
 could resurrect him if he

916
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:30,480
 wanted to.

917
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,760
 I even went to the mortuary

918
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,942
 and told them to bring him

919
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:36,686
 out, that I want to pray

920
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:37,810
 on his corpse.

921
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,350
And after a long process, 
they brought him out.

922
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,330
 Said, God, I am here now.

923
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,766
Been praying to you from America.

924
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:46,446
 But I'm here in this mortuary

925
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:47,390
 in Aba.

926
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,422
 Please wake this my

927
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:50,130
 brother.

928
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,810
 But God did it.

929
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,558
 And we buried him.

930
00:29:54,614 --> 00:29:55,850
 And we buried him.

931
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,260
 But God

932
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,040
 sees our pain and

933
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,848
 he never leaves us

934
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:06,540
 alone.

935
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,508
 And while we were

936
00:30:08,554 --> 00:30:09,500
 mourning,

937
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,472
 God made it possible

938
00:30:12,576 --> 00:30:14,104
 that his wife that was

939
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:16,024
 pregnant gave

940
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:17,180
 birth safely

941
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,020
 to his son.

942
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,380
 That is his replica.

943
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,500
 So as we look back

944
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,918
 at him will

945
00:30:26,974 --> 00:30:28,598
 be eight

946
00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:30,210
 years this year.

947
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,142
 We still have something to

948
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,290
 thank God for.

949
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,550
 I'm telling this story to

950
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,798
 somebody who may be going

951
00:30:37,854 --> 00:30:39,574
 through something out there,

952
00:30:39,742 --> 00:30:41,302
 and they may think that you

953
00:30:41,326 --> 00:30:42,250
 are alone.

954
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,350
 Some devout Christians like

955
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,350
 me have been through

956
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,170
 stuff.

957
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,844
 But God gives

958
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,240
 us the grace

959
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,920
 to know

960
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,720
 that there is hope

961
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,480
 after this world of sin,

962
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,120
 that there will be resurrection,

963
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,988
 when we are going to see

964
00:31:05,044 --> 00:31:06,400
 our loved ones.

965
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,556
 That instead of staying and

966
00:31:08,628 --> 00:31:09,760
 brooding

967
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,764
 on all the evils that

968
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:14,360
 happen every day,

969
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,318
 that we should

970
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:19,430
 realize the limited

971
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,558
 knowledge we have and

972
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:23,430
 trust God more because he

973
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,910
is the one that has all the answers.

974
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,890
 That's true.

975
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,838
 And when I was reading through

976
00:31:28,894 --> 00:31:30,330
 EV White's

977
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,414
 writings.

978
00:31:31,462 --> 00:31:32,450
 Excuse me.

979
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,742
 And she said that even

980
00:31:34,846 --> 00:31:36,598
 in heaven, there

981
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:38,070
 are some things we would

982
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,010
 not understand.

983
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,862
 Because even in heaven, we

984
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:43,008
 will still still be human

985
00:31:43,064 --> 00:31:45,152
beings that will not be God.

986
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:46,672
 A lot of things we will understand,

987
00:31:46,776 --> 00:31:47,900
 but not everything.

988
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,552
 Because even in heaven, we

989
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:51,140
 will not turn into God.

990
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,912
 We are still going to be

991
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:53,824
 human beings.

992
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:55,820
That was when I rested my case.

993
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,440
 I said, you know what?

994
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,752
 I'm a human being.

995
00:31:58,856 --> 00:32:00,512
 I'm grateful to be

996
00:32:00,536 --> 00:32:02,320
 here to experience this

997
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,840
 grace and mercy from an

998
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,060
 almighty God.

999
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,040
 And I will leave

1000
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,660
 him to be God

1001
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,210
 while I remain

1002
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,282
 the human being.

1003
00:32:12,386 --> 00:32:14,378
 So David in Psalm

1004
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,510
 73

1005
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,202
 was wondering, because

1006
00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:20,110
 he was a king,

1007
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,530
 and he was wondering

1008
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,594
 why kings

1009
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:27,418
 that do a lot of

1010
00:32:27,474 --> 00:32:29,178
 evil, that do

1011
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:30,778
 not fear God,

1012
00:32:30,954 --> 00:32:32,630
 that do everything

1013
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,750
but what God wants them to do.

1014
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,460
- Prospering.
- Yeah.

1015
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,320
 In fact, he was specific.

1016
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,492
 Why are they amassing

1017
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:42,680
 wealth, Lord,

1018
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,800
 why we have to struggle.

1019
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,080
 Why are they amassing wealth

1020
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,840
when they are doing the wrong thing?

1021
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,740
 But the

1022
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,148
 answer is

1023
00:32:56,204 --> 00:32:58,240
there that

1024
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,288
 he got that answer when he

1025
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:03,448
 step, when he

1026
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:05,048
 focused his

1027
00:33:05,104 --> 00:33:07,000
 attention to the sanctuary

1028
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,976
of God and that was when he got the answer.

1029
00:33:10,008 --> 00:33:11,496
 He said the answer was

1030
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:13,416
 found the sanctuary of God.

1031
00:33:13,448 --> 00:33:14,872
 Because you have to shift

1032
00:33:14,936 --> 00:33:15,940
 your focus

1033
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,600
 to God to

1034
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,992
 really get the answers.

1035
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:21,940
 Then God will speak to you

1036
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,700
 and tell you that

1037
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,896
 this is why

1038
00:33:25,968 --> 00:33:27,460
 I'm doing what I'm doing.

1039
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,114
 There is peace in this.

1040
00:33:30,202 --> 00:33:31,522
 And sometimes you may not

1041
00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:32,722
 still get all the answers,

1042
00:33:32,786 --> 00:33:34,482
 but we just have to shift

1043
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:35,470
 our focus

1044
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,950
 from trying to

1045
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,950
 envy the wicked

1046
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,978
 to focusing on

1047
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:45,030
 God and appreciating

1048
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,930
 him for being our God.

1049
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,578
 And one

1050
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:50,514
 thing as I studied it, that

1051
00:33:50,522 --> 00:33:51,630
 will help us,

1052
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,370
 apart from being a skeptical

1053
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,304
 theist of allowing God

1054
00:33:56,352 --> 00:33:57,220
 be God

1055
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,488
 and knowing that we still

1056
00:33:59,544 --> 00:34:00,928
 have limited knowledge, is

1057
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:02,340
 to ask yourself,

1058
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,300
 why am I serving God?

1059
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,440
 Am I serving God

1060
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,780
because I want to amass wealth

1061
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,688
 or am I serving God because

1062
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:14,260
 I'm responding

1063
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,512
 to his love for me?

1064
00:34:16,696 --> 00:34:18,320
 The reason why you're serving

1065
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,336
 God will determine

1066
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:21,420
 a lot of things.

1067
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,758
 I see some people that said,

1068
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:25,694
 ah, no me, I want

1069
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:27,518
 forget about get

1070
00:34:27,574 --> 00:34:29,566
 rich quick and die

1071
00:34:29,598 --> 00:34:30,930
 tomorrow is okay.

1072
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,070
 And their own reason is different.

1073
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,102
 Yeah, but I'm serving God

1074
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,670
 because his love for me is

1075
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,430
 so much and I

1076
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,270
 can't just help it but respond

1077
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,370
 to that love.

1078
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,502
 And that is why I want to

1079
00:34:43,526 --> 00:34:44,910
 encourage you today that

1080
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,622
 in this world of evil we

1081
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:48,449
can't really expect explain everything.

1082
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,789
 Let us not envy the

1083
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:51,589
 wicked.

1084
00:34:51,749 --> 00:34:53,189
 Let us not focus our

1085
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:55,061
 attention on the wicked and

1086
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:56,149
 their prosperity because

1087
00:34:56,189 --> 00:34:57,509
 they do prosper.

1088
00:34:57,669 --> 00:34:59,349
 And let me add quickly on

1089
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,169
 that, because in our,

1090
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:02,997
 in our present day today

1091
00:35:03,053 --> 00:35:04,179
 there is this

1092
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,645
 quest of

1093
00:35:06,797 --> 00:35:07,957
 let me make the money.

1094
00:35:08,013 --> 00:35:09,861
 Yes, I don't care how I

1095
00:35:09,885 --> 00:35:12,049
make the money, let me just have the money.

1096
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:14,405
 And that is a

1097
00:35:14,477 --> 00:35:16,277
 very dangerous place to be

1098
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,689
 as a child of God.

1099
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,848
 Because the end now

1100
00:35:19,904 --> 00:35:21,380
 justifies the means.

1101
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,096
 Once I have the money, it's

1102
00:35:23,128 --> 00:35:24,600
 okay even if it's 20 years.

1103
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,592
 Let me live and die.

1104
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,240
 I've seen a lot of young

1105
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,952
 people with that kind of

1106
00:35:28,976 --> 00:35:29,752
 mindset.

1107
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:31,944
That's not the plan of God for you.

1108
00:35:32,032 --> 00:35:33,144
 That's not the thought of

1109
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:34,120
 God for you.

1110
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,304
 That's the devil.

1111
00:35:35,352 --> 00:35:36,580
 And I've seen that

1112
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,224
that is so prevalent now.

1113
00:35:39,312 --> 00:35:40,760
 A lot of people want to make

1114
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,536
 money, they just don't

1115
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:44,188
 care how the money

1116
00:35:44,244 --> 00:35:44,892
 comes.

1117
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,988
 And they know the slang in

1118
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:47,920
 Nigeria.

1119
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,156
 Get which get rich quick

1120
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:51,132
 or die trying.

1121
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:52,600
 Yeah, you know,

1122
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,468
 that is not the right way

1123
00:35:55,524 --> 00:35:57,320
 to look at things because

1124
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,548
 I mean Just try

1125
00:35:59,604 --> 00:36:00,764
 and go the right way.

1126
00:36:00,852 --> 00:36:02,188
 That doesn't mean being

1127
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,396
Christian you cannot be rich.

1128
00:36:04,508 --> 00:36:06,092
 No, but you have to do it

1129
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:07,036
 the right way.

1130
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:09,152
 If at any point

1131
00:36:09,316 --> 00:36:11,100
 you are inflicting

1132
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,640
 evil upon others in the

1133
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,920
 process of trying to get

1134
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,260
 rich, then that is.

1135
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,488
 Yeah.

1136
00:36:18,664 --> 00:36:20,600
 So let's try as much as

1137
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,048
possible to do things the right way.

1138
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:23,816
 God's way.

1139
00:36:23,888 --> 00:36:24,744
 That's right.

1140
00:36:24,912 --> 00:36:26,760
 And that takes us to the

1141
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,460
 free will defense.

1142
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,300
 Freeway defense.

1143
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,232
 What's free will

1144
00:36:32,336 --> 00:36:33,180
 defense?

1145
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,020
We all know what free will is.

1146
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,180
 Ability to make a choice.

1147
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,336
 Ability to decide what

1148
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:42,400
 you want, to do what

1149
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,432
 you want at whatever point

1150
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,500
 in time.

1151
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,024
 Now, freeway

1152
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,944
 defense is defined

1153
00:36:48,992 --> 00:36:56,780
as the view, the like.

1154
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,520
 When you say it is the

1155
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,408
 misuse of

1156
00:37:01,464 --> 00:37:03,296
 the freeway that God gave

1157
00:37:03,328 --> 00:37:05,260
 us that led to the

1158
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,636
 problems we have.

1159
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:08,120
 That's free will

1160
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,360
 defense.

1161
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,360
 Now, we cannot

1162
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,900
 totally, completely understand

1163
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,852
 the problem of evil like

1164
00:37:15,876 --> 00:37:17,308
 we have been trying to explain.

1165
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:19,180
 When we get to heaven, we

1166
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,900
 know more.

1167
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,292
 And we are never going to

1168
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:23,276
 know everything otherwise

1169
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:24,716
 we become another

1170
00:37:24,788 --> 00:37:25,440
 God.

1171
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,260
 But when we get to

1172
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,202
 heaven, we know more.

1173
00:37:29,356 --> 00:37:31,222
 However, if

1174
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:32,406
 you look at it, when God

1175
00:37:32,438 --> 00:37:34,278
 created man, he gave us

1176
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:36,150
 the power to make

1177
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,970
 a choice.

1178
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,302
 That's what we refer to

1179
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:40,822
 as free will.

1180
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:42,870
 And there

1181
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,646
 is this view that

1182
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:46,598
 evil is the result of the

1183
00:37:46,654 --> 00:37:48,630
 misuse of the

1184
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,534
 free will that God

1185
00:37:50,662 --> 00:37:51,650
 gave us.

1186
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,806
 But that's.

1187
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,486
That's the partial truth. Yeah.

1188
00:37:54,518 --> 00:37:55,958
 People still make right choice.

1189
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:56,694
 Yeah.

1190
00:37:56,822 --> 00:37:58,294
 And they fall into problems.

1191
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:58,970
 Yes.

1192
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,382
 So that will lead

1193
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:03,238
 us to the origin of evil

1194
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,318
 and why evil reigns

1195
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:07,014
 on everybody whether you

1196
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:09,046
are righteous or not.

1197
00:38:09,198 --> 00:38:11,030
 Righteous is

1198
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,582
 a result of

1199
00:38:12,766 --> 00:38:14,678
 our roots that has been

1200
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:16,390
 corrupted since the

1201
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,038
 fall in the Garden

1202
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:19,370
 of Eden.

1203
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,638
 But even in that fall,

1204
00:38:21,694 --> 00:38:23,490
 God still gave us the power

1205
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,050
 to make a choice.

1206
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,238
 Now, without free

1207
00:38:27,294 --> 00:38:28,806
 will, there cannot be

1208
00:38:28,878 --> 00:38:30,130
 genuine love.

1209
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,822
 That's an issue because.

1210
00:38:32,926 --> 00:38:34,210
 Yes, because

1211
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,022
 some people think that.

1212
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:37,814
Why would God give us the free will?

1213
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,302
 He should have just made

1214
00:38:39,326 --> 00:38:40,370
 us to be like.

1215
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,694
 Yeah, just command us.

1216
00:38:42,782 --> 00:38:44,294
Yes.
Follow me.

1217
00:38:44,462 --> 00:38:46,358
 So you can never go right

1218
00:38:46,414 --> 00:38:47,302
 or left.

1219
00:38:47,486 --> 00:38:49,222
 But it's not going to

1220
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:50,370
 work like that.

1221
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,582
 That means you are

1222
00:38:52,606 --> 00:38:54,084
 forcing, you are being forced

1223
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:55,560
 to even love God.

1224
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,444
 So genuine love cannot

1225
00:38:57,492 --> 00:38:59,412
 exist without

1226
00:38:59,596 --> 00:39:00,880
 free will.

1227
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,572
 So free will,

1228
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:05,600
 though it makes evil possible.

1229
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,404
 Free will makes evil possible

1230
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:09,620
 because you don't have the

1231
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,188
 choice to be

1232
00:39:11,324 --> 00:39:13,060
 bad if you want to be

1233
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,732
 bad.

1234
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:15,044
 And you have the chance to

1235
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,676
 be good if you want to be

1236
00:39:16,748 --> 00:39:18,260
 good, to make a

1237
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:18,954
 choice.

1238
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:20,878
 But at the same

1239
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:22,718
 time, it is also the only

1240
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:23,950
 thing that makes possible

1241
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,774
 any love or goodness

1242
00:39:25,902 --> 00:39:27,534
 or joy worth

1243
00:39:27,662 --> 00:39:28,330
 having.

1244
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,302
 Because you know

1245
00:39:30,406 --> 00:39:32,350
 that you are in love

1246
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,210
 with someone

1247
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,170
 because you want to be,

1248
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,830
 because it pleases you from

1249
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,750
 Your heart, you are not

1250
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,686
 being compelled or

1251
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:43,550
 manipulated.

1252
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,298
 Tools like

1253
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:46,738
 today, in this

1254
00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:48,194
 generation, people

1255
00:39:48,362 --> 00:39:50,034
 manipulate situations

1256
00:39:50,162 --> 00:39:52,002
 to be in love with someone,

1257
00:39:52,186 --> 00:39:53,426
 maybe because of the riches

1258
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,074
 the person have so that they

1259
00:39:55,082 --> 00:39:56,870
 can inherit it or whatever.

1260
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,346
But that's not true love.

1261
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,154
 That's not genuine love.

1262
00:40:01,322 --> 00:40:03,010
 So God does not want

1263
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,010
 creatures that we love him.

1264
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:05,830
 Yes.

1265
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,150
 Dogmatically,

1266
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,322
 without the ability to make

1267
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:11,032
 a choice.

1268
00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:13,052
 And that's why he gave us

1269
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:15,000
 that free will.

1270
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,200
 So

1271
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,680
 if

1272
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,660
 God had taken away that free

1273
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,840
 will from us,

1274
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,940
 then we would be

1275
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,236
 like slaves.

1276
00:40:26,348 --> 00:40:28,092
 Yes, we'd be like

1277
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:29,468
 slaves who have no

1278
00:40:29,524 --> 00:40:31,320
 power to,

1279
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,124
 you know, you can't decide

1280
00:40:34,172 --> 00:40:35,580
 anything for your

1281
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,240
 sake.

1282
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,390
 And the danger in free

1283
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,542
 will is that when you are

1284
00:40:39,566 --> 00:40:41,862
making your choice, whether good 
or bad, whether right

1285
00:40:41,886 --> 00:40:42,982
 or wrong, God is not going

1286
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:43,782
 to stop you.

1287
00:40:43,886 --> 00:40:45,942
Yes.
And that's where in theology

1288
00:40:46,006 --> 00:40:48,210
we said that God took a big risk

1289
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,770
 because he can.

1290
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,370
 He allows us to choose

1291
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,090
 against him,

1292
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,070
 for him or

1293
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:58,838
 without him.

1294
00:40:58,894 --> 00:41:01,014
Yeah.
So he wants people that we

1295
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:02,970
 voluntarily, genuinely

1296
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,532
 align with Him.

1297
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:06,068
 And that's why he gave us

1298
00:41:06,124 --> 00:41:08,052
 that choice, so that

1299
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:10,244
we can follow him with true love.

1300
00:41:10,332 --> 00:41:11,828
 Now let's look at Genesis

1301
00:41:11,924 --> 00:41:14,400
 2:16

1302
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,920
 and 17.

1303
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,440
 Yes.

1304
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,308
 If you find it, you can.

1305
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:21,540
 Otherwise I can read it.

1306
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,364
 And the Lord God commanded

1307
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:25,220
 the man, you are free

1308
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,172
 to eat from any tree in

1309
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:28,990
 the garden, but you must

1310
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,950
 not eat from.

1311
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,342
 You must not eat from the

1312
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:32,622
 tree of the knowledge of

1313
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:33,342
 good and evil.

1314
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:35,006
Okay.
For you.

1315
00:41:35,158 --> 00:41:37,086
 For when you eat from it,

1316
00:41:37,238 --> 00:41:39,182
 you will certainly die.

1317
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,158
Yes. The law.

1318
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:41,870
 God said, it is not good

1319
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,102
 for the man to be alone.

1320
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:44,638
- That's okay.
- That's okay.

1321
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:45,902
 My, my.

1322
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:47,790
 My version says, you will

1323
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,610
die before the end of the day.

1324
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,246
 Okay.

1325
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:53,134
That is, it's an instant thing.

1326
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:54,696
 There's meaning that

1327
00:41:54,768 --> 00:41:56,504
 once you start the process,

1328
00:41:56,592 --> 00:41:58,380
 it's no longer reversible.

1329
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,392
 That's what God is saying.

1330
00:42:00,496 --> 00:42:02,216
 This one says, if you eat

1331
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:04,040
 it, you will die

1332
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,072
 before the end of

1333
00:42:06,096 --> 00:42:06,980
 the day.

1334
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,888
 But unfortunately, we took

1335
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:10,456
 that day to be literal.

1336
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:11,688
 Something that will happen

1337
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:13,384
 instantly, just that day,

1338
00:42:13,472 --> 00:42:15,060
 but that day.

1339
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,904
 Human beings were actually

1340
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,152
 dead from that

1341
00:42:18,256 --> 00:42:19,000
 moment.

1342
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,860
 However,

1343
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,608
 why would God give

1344
00:42:22,664 --> 00:42:23,700
 that command?

1345
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,952
 This command further

1346
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:27,856
 emphasizes that there was

1347
00:42:27,928 --> 00:42:28,700
 free will.

1348
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,008
 Because if there was no free

1349
00:42:31,064 --> 00:42:32,304
 will, he would not need to

1350
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:33,872
 be telling them that if you

1351
00:42:33,896 --> 00:42:35,072
 do this, this will be the

1352
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:35,872
 end result.

1353
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:37,152
 If you go the other way,

1354
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:38,368
 this will be the end result.

1355
00:42:38,424 --> 00:42:40,208
 It means there was

1356
00:42:40,344 --> 00:42:41,120
 free will.

1357
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,056
 And that was why it was

1358
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:44,640
 necessary to

1359
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,186
 give that

1360
00:42:46,338 --> 00:42:47,114
 command.

1361
00:42:47,242 --> 00:42:48,602
 So if you look at that

1362
00:42:48,626 --> 00:42:50,922
situation, human beings fail.

1363
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,618
 Adam and Eve failed because

1364
00:42:52,674 --> 00:42:54,634
 of the misuse of that

1365
00:42:54,802 --> 00:42:55,750
 free will.

1366
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,498
 That is it.

1367
00:42:57,554 --> 00:42:59,002
 It was because of the misuse.

1368
00:42:59,066 --> 00:43:00,698
 So God is not to blame.

1369
00:43:00,794 --> 00:43:02,430
 God is not at fault.

1370
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,458
 No, never.

1371
00:43:04,594 --> 00:43:05,930
It's just like you have a child.

1372
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,050
 You say, go to school.

1373
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,922
 You must go to school so

1374
00:43:08,946 --> 00:43:10,234
 that you will be educated

1375
00:43:10,282 --> 00:43:11,778
 and you can show your face

1376
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:13,826
wherever others are, you know?

1377
00:43:13,898 --> 00:43:15,362
 And you refuse to go to school.

1378
00:43:15,466 --> 00:43:17,042
It's a free will.
It's a choice.

1379
00:43:17,186 --> 00:43:18,514
 You can't blame the parent

1380
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,498
 for not sending the child

1381
00:43:20,634 --> 00:43:21,550
 to school.

1382
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:22,670
 So

1383
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,890
 like we said, without free

1384
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,682
 will, we will just be like

1385
00:43:27,786 --> 00:43:28,386
 machines.

1386
00:43:28,498 --> 00:43:29,666
 However quickly.

1387
00:43:29,778 --> 00:43:31,506
 I want us to read a number

1388
00:43:31,578 --> 00:43:32,242
 of.

1389
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:33,282
 Yes, I want.

1390
00:43:33,306 --> 00:43:34,450
 I want us to read a number

1391
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,146
 of verses to see

1392
00:43:36,298 --> 00:43:38,542
sequentially how this thing unfold.

1393
00:43:38,626 --> 00:43:40,690
Deuteronomy 7, 12, 13.

1394
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,730
Deuteronomy 7, 12, and 13.

1395
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,606
 And then, please, next person

1396
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:47,142
 should quickly open to

1397
00:43:47,246 --> 00:43:49,330
Joshua 24:14.

1398
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,686
 We read all this quickly,

1399
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,686
 and then you see how one

1400
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:56,646
thing happens after the other.
Okay?

1401
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:58,534
 Deuteronomy 7:12

1402
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,390
 says, Then

1403
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,210
 it shall come to pass

1404
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,774
 because you listen

1405
00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:06,330
 to these judgments

1406
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,348
 and keep and do

1407
00:44:08,404 --> 00:44:10,124
 them that the Lord your God

1408
00:44:10,172 --> 00:44:12,140
 will keep with

1409
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,012
 you the covenant and the

1410
00:44:14,036 --> 00:44:15,880
 mercy which he.

1411
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,132
Which he swore to your fathers.
Yeah.

1412
00:44:19,196 --> 00:44:20,620
 Read the thing as well.

1413
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,652
 And he will love you

1414
00:44:22,756 --> 00:44:24,040
 and bless you

1415
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,116
and multiply you.

1416
00:44:27,188 --> 00:44:27,868
 Yes.

1417
00:44:28,044 --> 00:44:29,980
 He will also bless the

1418
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:30,652
 fruit.

1419
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:32,412
 The fruit of your

1420
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,370
 womb and the

1421
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:35,602
 fruit of your land.

1422
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:36,498
 Yes.

1423
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,626
 Your grain and

1424
00:44:38,778 --> 00:44:41,058
your new wine and your oil.

1425
00:44:41,194 --> 00:44:43,074
- Okay, thank you.
- That's okay.

1426
00:44:43,122 --> 00:44:45,074
 Now look at the first sentence

1427
00:44:45,122 --> 00:44:46,594
 was that if you

1428
00:44:46,682 --> 00:44:48,530
 completely obey these

1429
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,562
 laws, that's a

1430
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:51,350
 condition.

1431
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,234
 So if you completely obey.

1432
00:44:53,282 --> 00:44:54,914
 So you have a free will

1433
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:56,610
 of making your choice.

1434
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,210
 If you completely obey this

1435
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,490
 law, these are the blessings

1436
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,322
 that we follow.

1437
00:45:01,506 --> 00:45:02,570
 Now let's see.

1438
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:06,150
Joshua 24:14, 15.

1439
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,226
 Now, fear the Lord and serve

1440
00:45:09,258 --> 00:45:10,378
 him with all

1441
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:11,370
 faithfulness.

1442
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,018
 Throw away the gods

1443
00:45:13,194 --> 00:45:15,162
 your ancestors worshiped

1444
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:16,874
 beyond the Ephraim river

1445
00:45:17,002 --> 00:45:18,442
 and in Egypt, and serve the

1446
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:19,098
 Lord.

1447
00:45:19,274 --> 00:45:21,082
 But if serving the Lord

1448
00:45:21,146 --> 00:45:22,602
 seems undesirable to

1449
00:45:22,626 --> 00:45:24,282
 you, then choose for

1450
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:25,786
 yourselves this day whom

1451
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:27,642
 you will serve, whether the

1452
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:29,146
 gods your ancestors served

1453
00:45:29,178 --> 00:45:31,146
 before the Ephraim

1454
00:45:31,258 --> 00:45:32,538
 or the gods of the

1455
00:45:32,594 --> 00:45:34,474
 Amorites in whose

1456
00:45:34,522 --> 00:45:35,450
 land you are living.

1457
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:36,810
 But as for me, my

1458
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:37,710
 household.

1459
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,458
 And then what?

1460
00:45:40,514 --> 00:45:41,338
 What did they say?

1461
00:45:41,394 --> 00:45:43,390
 How did the Israelites respond?

1462
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,290
 Then the people answered,

1463
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,306
 far be it from us to forsake

1464
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:51,418
the Lord to serve all the gods.
Thank you.

1465
00:45:51,474 --> 00:45:52,650
 So they make a choice.

1466
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,586
 Okay, so Joshua was telling

1467
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,058
 them, fear the Lord, follow

1468
00:45:56,114 --> 00:45:56,858
 his rule.

1469
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,362
 But if you think that you

1470
00:45:58,386 --> 00:45:59,786
 want to continue worshiping

1471
00:45:59,818 --> 00:46:01,290
 the idols that were being

1472
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:02,550
 watched where you left,

1473
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:03,898
 go ahead.

1474
00:46:04,034 --> 00:46:05,674
 If you think you don't want

1475
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:07,450
 to worship, that this land

1476
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,650
 was being occupied by the

1477
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,442
 Amorites before, now they

1478
00:46:10,466 --> 00:46:11,290
 have their gods.
 If

1479
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:12,270
you think that's the

1480
00:46:12,294 --> 00:46:13,754
God you want to worship?
Go ahead.

1481
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:15,194
 But as for me, in my house,

1482
00:46:15,282 --> 00:46:16,362
 we worship the Lord.

1483
00:46:16,426 --> 00:46:19,430
They made a stand. They made a
choice. They said, okay, we follow you.

1484
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,124
 They said, we follow you.

1485
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:22,760
 Now let's see what happened.

1486
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,948
 The same people said, we

1487
00:46:25,004 --> 00:46:25,732
 follow you.

1488
00:46:25,836 --> 00:46:27,440
 Psalms 81,

1489
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,996
 Psalm 61.

1490
00:46:29,068 --> 00:46:30,644
 But no, my people

1491
00:46:30,732 --> 00:46:31,572
 wouldn't listen.

1492
00:46:31,636 --> 00:46:32,772
 They would not listen.

1493
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:35,092
Israel did not want me around.

1494
00:46:35,196 --> 00:46:35,880
 Yes.

1495
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,940
 So I let them follow their

1496
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,800
 own stubborn desires.

1497
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,988
 Living according to their

1498
00:46:42,044 --> 00:46:43,124
 own desires.

1499
00:46:43,172 --> 00:46:43,800
 Yes.

1500
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,174
 Oh, that my people

1501
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:47,770
 will listen to me.

1502
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:50,270
 Oh, that Israel will

1503
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:51,870
 follow me walking in my

1504
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:52,690
 path.

1505
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:54,846
 How quickly I would

1506
00:46:54,918 --> 00:46:56,610
 subdue their enemies.

1507
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,022
 How soon my hands will

1508
00:46:59,046 --> 00:47:00,770
 be upon their folds.

1509
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,950
 Okay, so you see, these

1510
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,086
 are the people said, oh,

1511
00:47:05,118 --> 00:47:06,330
 we will follow you.

1512
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,270
 They made a choice, very

1513
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:10,894
clear choice, and God bless them.
They changed their minds.

1514
00:47:10,942 --> 00:47:12,410
 Then they changed their mind.

1515
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,790
 They put their free will

1516
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:15,526
 through you.

1517
00:47:15,598 --> 00:47:17,398
 Thank you, our body, soul.

1518
00:47:17,494 --> 00:47:18,758
 They made you of their

1519
00:47:18,814 --> 00:47:20,210
 constitutional rights,

1520
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:21,970
 called free will.

1521
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,958
 And then now they

1522
00:47:24,014 --> 00:47:25,090
 turn against

1523
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:26,150
 God.

1524
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,894
 And so God said, ah, Oh,

1525
00:47:27,942 --> 00:47:29,590
 I wish you followed me.

1526
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,130
 Then I will quickly

1527
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,974
finish your enemies for you.

1528
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,478
 But they changed.

1529
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:37,142
 They did not follow God.

1530
00:47:37,206 --> 00:47:38,998
 So we're talking about the

1531
00:47:39,054 --> 00:47:41,128
power of free will.

1532
00:47:41,264 --> 00:47:43,140
 So more or less,

1533
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,208
 man is the

1534
00:47:45,344 --> 00:47:46,760
 cause of whatever

1535
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,200
 consequences he

1536
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:48,940
 gets.

1537
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,860
 Now, finally,

1538
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,776
 Isaiah 66:4

1539
00:47:52,848 --> 00:47:53,460
 says,

1540
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,928
 you refused to

1541
00:47:55,984 --> 00:47:57,576
 answer when I called

1542
00:47:57,648 --> 00:47:58,260
 out.

1543
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,112
 You paid no attention to

1544
00:48:01,136 --> 00:48:02,200
 my instructions.

1545
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,072
 Instead, you did what I

1546
00:48:04,096 --> 00:48:05,688
 hated, not

1547
00:48:05,744 --> 00:48:07,374
 knowing it was wrong.

1548
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:09,266
 So it was a deliberate act.

1549
00:48:09,338 --> 00:48:10,402
 You knew it was wrong and

1550
00:48:10,426 --> 00:48:11,218
 you did it.

1551
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:12,770
 Now I will punish

1552
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,290
 you in a

1553
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,986
 way you dread

1554
00:48:16,098 --> 00:48:17,042
 the most.

1555
00:48:17,226 --> 00:48:18,470
 That's God

1556
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,834
 speaking to his own people

1557
00:48:21,002 --> 00:48:22,882
 because they made use of

1558
00:48:22,906 --> 00:48:24,510
 their constitutional right,

1559
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,150
 free will.

1560
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:28,850
 The lesson here is that that

1561
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,226
 free will still exists

1562
00:48:30,338 --> 00:48:30,990
 today.

1563
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:33,246
 It still exists today.

1564
00:48:33,418 --> 00:48:34,854
 So you call it amendment.

1565
00:48:34,902 --> 00:48:36,374
 This amendment, whatever

1566
00:48:36,502 --> 00:48:37,730
 freeway, has

1567
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:40,278
both sides.
Yes.

1568
00:48:40,374 --> 00:48:41,606
 It has good

1569
00:48:41,678 --> 00:48:43,542
 consequences and it

1570
00:48:43,566 --> 00:48:45,254
 also has bad consequences.

1571
00:48:45,302 --> 00:48:47,094
Yes.
So let us use our free will.

1572
00:48:47,182 --> 00:48:47,782
 Yes.

1573
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:48,650
 Yes.

1574
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,454
Okay.
So.

1575
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:52,502
 And you know, so

1576
00:48:52,526 --> 00:48:53,814
 far we've been looking at

1577
00:48:53,822 --> 00:48:55,078
 the problem of evil.

1578
00:48:55,174 --> 00:48:57,110
And then the big question
came up.

1579
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,080
 If God is all good and powerful,

1580
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,820
 why is there a lot of evil?

1581
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,388
 And then we have established

1582
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:04,020
 that the free

1583
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,640
 will to choose

1584
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,684
 was there for everyone.

1585
00:49:07,852 --> 00:49:09,172
 You have the free will to

1586
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,316
choose, good or
bad.

1587
00:49:11,468 --> 00:49:12,400
 But then,

1588
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,804
 can love and evil

1589
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:15,800
 coexist?

1590
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,440
 That is the question.

1591
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,860
 When we say evil, how

1592
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,572
 does evil love comes

1593
00:49:21,676 --> 00:49:22,596
 into that.

1594
00:49:22,748 --> 00:49:24,468
 So the lesson here is

1595
00:49:24,524 --> 00:49:26,328
 telling us that the

1596
00:49:26,384 --> 00:49:27,848
 free will to

1597
00:49:27,904 --> 00:49:29,560
 choose between good and

1598
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,528
 evil was first of all even

1599
00:49:31,584 --> 00:49:33,688
born out of God's love towards
us.

1600
00:49:33,824 --> 00:49:35,080
 He didn't want to force us

1601
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,460
 to do nothing.

1602
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,776
 He gave us that free will

1603
00:49:38,848 --> 00:49:40,248
 because he loves us so much.

1604
00:49:40,304 --> 00:49:41,912
 He didn't want us to be just

1605
00:49:42,096 --> 00:49:43,752
 robots that he can just

1606
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:45,240
 manipulate all around.

1607
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,776
 So he gave us the free will

1608
00:49:46,848 --> 00:49:48,840
 that was his first sign

1609
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,280
 of love towards us.

1610
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,736
 So God has granted courage

1611
00:49:51,768 --> 00:49:52,920
 of free will because it is

1612
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,420
 necessary for love.

1613
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,610
 Misuse of this free

1614
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,146
 will is the cause of evil.

1615
00:49:58,178 --> 00:49:59,442
 We have established that.

1616
00:49:59,546 --> 00:50:01,330
 Again, many questions remain.

1617
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,362
 God allows evil for

1618
00:50:03,386 --> 00:50:04,146
 a time.

1619
00:50:04,298 --> 00:50:06,546
Why passionately despising it?

1620
00:50:06,698 --> 00:50:08,450
 Because to exclude its

1621
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,834
possibility would exclude love.

1622
00:50:10,922 --> 00:50:12,754
 And to destroy it prematurely

1623
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:13,986
 would damage the trust

1624
00:50:14,098 --> 00:50:15,698
 necessary for love.

1625
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:17,202
 He wanted us to trust

1626
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:17,922
 him.

1627
00:50:18,106 --> 00:50:20,066
 And for someone

1628
00:50:20,138 --> 00:50:21,852
 to love the other person

1629
00:50:21,956 --> 00:50:23,452
 genuinely, they have to be

1630
00:50:23,476 --> 00:50:25,164
 able to trust that person.

1631
00:50:25,252 --> 00:50:26,524
 It's just like myself and

1632
00:50:26,532 --> 00:50:27,276
 my husband.

1633
00:50:27,388 --> 00:50:28,540
 There has to be some level

1634
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,172
 of trust for us to be

1635
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:31,548
 this much in love.

1636
00:50:31,684 --> 00:50:32,748
So.
So, same thing.

1637
00:50:32,804 --> 00:50:35,068
God wants us to trust him.
So you're in love.

1638
00:50:35,124 --> 00:50:38,280
Yes, we know.

1639
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,760
 Okay, so

1640
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,300
 the exercise of

1641
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,284
 force is contrary

1642
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,386
to the principle of God's government.

1643
00:50:46,508 --> 00:50:47,974
 God never forces nothing

1644
00:50:48,022 --> 00:50:48,662
 on us.

1645
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:50,198
 He loves us so much, he lets

1646
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,134
 us exercise our free will.

1647
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:53,910
 He desires only the

1648
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:54,918
 service of love.

1649
00:50:54,974 --> 00:50:56,374
 And love cannot be commanded.

1650
00:50:56,422 --> 00:50:57,878
Of course, we already know that.

1651
00:50:57,934 --> 00:50:59,622
 Everybody in love knows that

1652
00:50:59,646 --> 00:51:01,750
you cannot force love on someone.

1653
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:03,062
 I mean, some people try to

1654
00:51:03,086 --> 00:51:04,342
 do that, but it's, it's not

1655
00:51:04,366 --> 00:51:04,966
 going to work.

1656
00:51:05,038 --> 00:51:06,342
 Yes, all right.

1657
00:51:06,446 --> 00:51:08,070
 And, and

1658
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:09,990
 love cannot be commanded.

1659
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,942
 It cannot be won by

1660
00:51:11,966 --> 00:51:12,822
 force or authority.

1661
00:51:12,886 --> 00:51:14,566
 Only by love is love

1662
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:15,264
 awakened.

1663
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:17,960
Yes. To know God is to love him.

1664
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,660
 His character must be

1665
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,532
 manifested in contrast to

1666
00:51:21,556 --> 00:51:23,212
 the character of Satan.

1667
00:51:23,276 --> 00:51:24,860
 That was something from

1668
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,780
 desire of ages that lng White

1669
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,900
 has put out there.

1670
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,836
 So, but then in all of this,

1671
00:51:29,908 --> 00:51:31,356
 how do we gain

1672
00:51:31,468 --> 00:51:33,040
 confidence to trust

1673
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,020
 in God's goodness?

1674
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,588
 If there is so much, despite

1675
00:51:36,644 --> 00:51:38,060
 all this evil happening around

1676
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,452
 us in the world, how do we

1677
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,356
 get so much confidence

1678
00:51:41,468 --> 00:51:43,036
 to trust God's

1679
00:51:43,068 --> 00:51:43,916
 goodness?

1680
00:51:44,108 --> 00:51:45,564
 How are we sure that

1681
00:51:45,732 --> 00:51:47,260
 God's goodness is all is

1682
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,492
 going to follow us?

1683
00:51:48,676 --> 00:51:50,188
 They wanted us to read the

1684
00:51:50,244 --> 00:51:53,004
book of Romans, chapter 8 and verse 18.

1685
00:51:53,092 --> 00:51:55,852
But I want someone to please
open to the book of Revelation,

1686
00:51:55,996 --> 00:51:58,028
chapter 21, verse 2 to 3.

1687
00:51:58,084 --> 00:51:59,388
 Should I read the 18?

1688
00:51:59,524 --> 00:52:00,812
 Yeah, go ahead and do 8 to

1689
00:52:00,836 --> 00:52:01,880
 18 as well.

1690
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:03,804
 Verse 18.

1691
00:52:03,892 --> 00:52:05,484
 Eight, 18, yes.

1692
00:52:05,612 --> 00:52:07,596
 Yet what we suffer now

1693
00:52:07,668 --> 00:52:09,018
 is, is nothing

1694
00:52:09,114 --> 00:52:10,762
 compared to the glory he

1695
00:52:10,786 --> 00:52:12,442
 will reveal to us later.

1696
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,390
 Amen.

1697
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:14,426
 That's it.

1698
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:15,242
 Amen.

1699
00:52:15,386 --> 00:52:17,178
 So one, we're

1700
00:52:17,194 --> 00:52:18,890
 gonna go to the next one.

1701
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:20,230
 But before then,

1702
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,218
 whenever we cannot see through

1703
00:52:22,274 --> 00:52:23,722
 darkness, God can see the

1704
00:52:23,746 --> 00:52:24,954
 end from the beginning.

1705
00:52:25,082 --> 00:52:26,474
 It is the end that we're

1706
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:27,290
 focusing on.

1707
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:28,650
 And according to that book

1708
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,106
 of Romans, chapter 8, verse

1709
00:52:30,138 --> 00:52:31,898
 18, the suffering

1710
00:52:31,994 --> 00:52:33,546
 that we might experience

1711
00:52:33,698 --> 00:52:35,354
 Right now, because of evil,

1712
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,328
 that abandoned world, the

1713
00:52:37,384 --> 00:52:38,592
 suffering, whatever suffering

1714
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:39,952
 we might have experienced,

1715
00:52:40,016 --> 00:52:41,856
 that all might going to,

1716
00:52:41,928 --> 00:52:42,944
 that we might eventually

1717
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:44,512
 end up experiencing does

1718
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,432
 not compare with the

1719
00:52:46,456 --> 00:52:48,368
 glory that will be revealed

1720
00:52:48,464 --> 00:52:50,176
 in us when Jesus

1721
00:52:50,288 --> 00:52:51,472
 comes the second time.

1722
00:52:51,576 --> 00:52:52,880
 Let us try and read the book

1723
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,344
 of Revelation 21,

1724
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,768
3 and 4 if you have it.

1725
00:52:56,824 --> 00:52:58,208
Revelation.
Okay, I'm there.

1726
00:52:58,264 --> 00:53:00,032
 It says, and I heard a

1727
00:53:00,056 --> 00:53:01,584
 loud voice from heaven

1728
00:53:01,632 --> 00:53:03,462
 saying, behold,

1729
00:53:03,606 --> 00:53:05,238
 the tabernacle of

1730
00:53:05,294 --> 00:53:06,742
 God is with

1731
00:53:06,846 --> 00:53:08,774
 men and

1732
00:53:08,862 --> 00:53:10,438
 he will dwell with

1733
00:53:10,494 --> 00:53:12,134
 them and

1734
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:13,686
 they shall be his

1735
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:14,370
 people.

1736
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,050
 God himself

1737
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,222
 will be with them

1738
00:53:19,326 --> 00:53:21,046
 and will be their God.

1739
00:53:21,158 --> 00:53:21,878
 Amen.

1740
00:53:21,974 --> 00:53:23,734
 And God will wipe

1741
00:53:23,782 --> 00:53:25,030
 away every

1742
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:27,206
fear from their eyes.

1743
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:28,800
 There shall be no

1744
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,060
 more death,

1745
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,160
 no more

1746
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,952
 sorrow, nor

1747
00:53:34,136 --> 00:53:34,980
 crying.

1748
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,248
 There shall be no

1749
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:38,900
 more pain.

1750
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,460
 No.

1751
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,460
 For the former things

1752
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,152
have all passed away.

1753
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:46,000
 Amen.

1754
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,376
 And that is the conclusion

1755
00:53:47,408 --> 00:53:48,544
 of the whole matter.

1756
00:53:48,712 --> 00:53:50,420
 Because eventually

1757
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,896
 God is going

1758
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:54,140
 to bring

1759
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:55,270
 is

1760
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:58,346
 kingdom here to us.

1761
00:53:58,418 --> 00:53:59,578
 We're gonna reign with Him.

1762
00:53:59,634 --> 00:54:02,410
Eventually there's gonna 
be a new heaven and a

1763
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:03,338
 new earth.

1764
00:54:03,514 --> 00:54:05,194
 Whatever it is that we've

1765
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,858
 suffered on this

1766
00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:08,842
 planet earth that we consider

1767
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:10,442
 as so much evil to

1768
00:54:10,466 --> 00:54:12,442
 us does not compare to the

1769
00:54:12,466 --> 00:54:14,234
glory that is going to come eventually.

1770
00:54:14,282 --> 00:54:15,498
 And that's what should always

1771
00:54:15,554 --> 00:54:17,146
 be at the back of our

1772
00:54:17,218 --> 00:54:19,066
 minds whenever

1773
00:54:19,178 --> 00:54:20,858
 we remember that there is

1774
00:54:20,914 --> 00:54:21,994
 so much evil.

1775
00:54:22,122 --> 00:54:23,978
 And most importantly, this

1776
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:25,450
 lesson is also telling us

1777
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,130
 that God loves us so much

1778
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,858
 that he sent Jesus Christ

1779
00:54:28,994 --> 00:54:30,458
 to come and die for us.

1780
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:32,410
That is his love towards us.

1781
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,754
 He knew this was going to

1782
00:54:33,762 --> 00:54:34,890
 happen when he gave us the

1783
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:35,546
 free will.

1784
00:54:35,618 --> 00:54:37,418
 But he, he is so

1785
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,162
 loving as he is, he made

1786
00:54:39,186 --> 00:54:40,858
 a provision for our salvation.

1787
00:54:40,954 --> 00:54:42,618
 He made a provision for

1788
00:54:42,674 --> 00:54:43,610
 redemption.

1789
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:45,466
And that's why I sent Jesus Christ.

1790
00:54:45,538 --> 00:54:46,730
 So the death of Jesus Christ

1791
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,590
 on the cross of Calvary is

1792
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,430
 the fulfillment of

1793
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:52,090
 that love again

1794
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,222
 of God towards we

1795
00:54:54,326 --> 00:54:55,646
 his own people.

1796
00:54:55,718 --> 00:54:56,894
 I pray the Lord will bless

1797
00:54:56,942 --> 00:54:58,510
 us as we continue to have

1798
00:54:58,550 --> 00:54:59,950
 understanding of this words.

1799
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:00,686
 Amen.

1800
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:02,382
 The good news is what Dr.

1801
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:04,398
 Esther has said,

1802
00:55:04,454 --> 00:55:05,690
 that there is hope.

1803
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,382
 Despite the

1804
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:10,158
 shortcomings, the

1805
00:55:10,214 --> 00:55:11,854
 experiences, painful

1806
00:55:11,902 --> 00:55:12,916
 experiences,

1807
00:55:13,078 --> 00:55:14,632
 disappointment that you have

1808
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:16,600
 had to face difficulties,

1809
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,168
 poverty, sickness, the death

1810
00:55:18,224 --> 00:55:19,580
 of your loved ones,

1811
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,024
the injustices you have faced.

1812
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,720
 We are encouraged

1813
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,528
 to know that

1814
00:55:25,664 --> 00:55:26,904
 there is hope.

1815
00:55:27,072 --> 00:55:28,760
 The good news there is that

1816
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,260
 Jesus will return.

1817
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,200
 And his returning will

1818
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,780
 wipe everything

1819
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,616
 that has cost us pain

1820
00:55:36,808 --> 00:55:37,656
 before that.

1821
00:55:37,728 --> 00:55:39,016
 I think that should be

1822
00:55:39,088 --> 00:55:41,054
something very confident to you.

1823
00:55:41,142 --> 00:55:42,910
 Dear brothers and sisters.

1824
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,878
 On this note we are going

1825
00:55:44,934 --> 00:55:46,730
 to close this

1826
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,450
 discussion

1827
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,250
 as we sing

1828
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,622
 that to demonstrate that

1829
00:55:52,646 --> 00:55:54,462
 we continue to love Jesus

1830
00:55:54,526 --> 00:55:55,770
 until that day

1831
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:57,570
 returns.

1832
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,210
 I love

1833
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:04,996
 thee.

1834
00:56:05,158 --> 00:56:06,740
 In life

1835
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,140
I belong

1836
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,580
 and say

1837
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,282
 when the

1838
00:56:33,466 --> 00:56:35,510
 rescue

1839
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:36,770
 lies

1840
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:38,550
 cold

1841
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,280
 in my

1842
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,956
 shots of

1843
00:57:01,108 --> 00:57:02,000
 glory.

1844
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,280
 Amen.

1845
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,810
 I'll sing

1846
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,566
 with the

1847
00:57:28,718 --> 00:57:29,410
 little

1848
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,790
 Jesus is

1849
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:51,150
 now

1850
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:55,870
Pastor Jen Pray for us.

1851
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,802
 Father, thank you for loving

1852
00:57:58,866 --> 00:57:59,470
 us.

1853
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,858
 Even though there are many

1854
00:58:01,914 --> 00:58:03,390
 things we don't understand.

1855
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,890
 We thank you for

1856
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,826
 extending your love and mercy

1857
00:58:07,858 --> 00:58:08,590
 to us.

1858
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:10,850
 Please give

1859
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:12,770
 us the grace to

1860
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:14,636
 trust you more because

1861
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:16,636
 we know that you

1862
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:19,080
have the best in mind for us.

1863
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,196
 This grace we pray

1864
00:58:21,228 --> 00:58:23,708
for in Jesus name.

1865
00:58:23,844 --> 00:58:24,880
 Amen.

1866
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:26,780
 Thank you so very much for

1867
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,724
 studying with us.

1868
00:58:27,812 --> 00:58:29,436
 Once again there

1869
00:58:29,508 --> 00:58:30,600
 is hope.

1870
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,540
 Remember that soon,

1871
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,120
 and very soon,

1872
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,396
 Jesus will return.

1873
00:58:36,468 --> 00:58:38,188
 We encourage you to keep

1874
00:58:38,244 --> 00:58:40,550
trusting until then.
God bless.
